# wasm-cpu-simulator

## Overview
Wasm-cpu-simulator is a program designed to parse and simulate the processing of WebAssembly (WASM) byte code. It aims to emulate the WASM Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and provides a detailed simulation of the WASM code execution process. 

## Key Features
WASM Byte Code Parsing: Reads and analyzes the structure and instruction set of WASM binary files.
Instruction Execution Simulation: Simulates the execution process of WASM instructions based on the analyzed byte code.
Debug Information Display: Provides valuable debugging information such as the status of instruction execution, memory state, and stack changes.
